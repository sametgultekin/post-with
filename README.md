# post-with

Post-with is a posting/bookmarking app that you can post new stuff and tag them. It supports rich media embedding, so whether your post contains some youtube video, or an external link, you can preview it.


## Features

* *You can post.* You can post new content by providing a text. Post content supports rich media embedding. When it detects an embeddable rich media(youtube, vimeo, soundcloud, image, link, etc.), it embeds the media and provides a preview.
* *There are tags.* Tags are containers of posts. A post, which is tagged with, is accessible from the tag's page. A post can have multiple tags. You can create a tag with a name, edit or delete it whenever you need.
* *A list is provided.* You can access all of your post in one place or from a tag in the tag list.


## Skillsets

This challenge requires frontend and backend skillsets. It can be frontend-only or full-stack. 


## Tools and Technologies

For the frontend side, this challenge should use javascript, html and css. It can make a good use of coffeescript, sass, jquery, a client-side mv*(backbonejs, emberjs, angularjs, knockoutjs, etc.), any other ui-kit(bootstrap, foundation, a custom one etc.), framework and more. If you don't plan to implement it for backend side as well, then another persistency option is local storage.

For the backend side, this challenge can use ruby on rails, sinatra, nodejs(express) and should provide a restful json api.

If you are a kind of a full-stack guy, you can use your framework's conventions and power them up with the frontend tools expressed above.
